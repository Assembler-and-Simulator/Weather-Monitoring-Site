# Weather-Monitoring-Site
Environmental Monitoring and Reporting System: Design a system for monitoring environmental data (air quality, pollution levels, etc.) in local communities and providing real-time reports and alerts to residents and authorities.

We have created a user-friendly website that allows users to check the air quality index, current temperature, rain forecast, wind speed, humidity, and visibility information for any city of their choice. Additionally, the website provides helpful suggestions and potential health impacts based on the current AQI. All the necessary information is presented in a clear and organized manner to reduce any cognitive load. To access the website, users simply need to run the file by launching app.py. We developed the website using Flask, along with Python and HTML.j2. We utilized two APIs - one to retrieve AQI information and the other to obtain other details.
